### State Management
- **Zustand stores** for jobs, candidates, and assessments
- **Persistent storage** using Zustand's persist middleware
- **Local-first** approach with IndexedDB backup
- **Optimistic updates** for better UX
- **Automatic rollback** on failures

### Data Flow
1. User interactions trigger store actions
2. Store updates UI optimistically
3. Changes persisted to IndexedDB
4. On refresh, state restored from IndexedDB
5. No external API dependency

### Design System
- **Natural Color Palette:** Sage, moss, stone, and earth tones
- **Typography:** Inter (body), Crimson Text (headings), JetBrains Mono (code)
- **Components:** Reusable cards, buttons, inputs with consistent styling
- **Animations:** Fade, slide, and scale transitions
- **Responsive Design:** Mobile-first approach

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 16+ 
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/talentflow.git
   cd talentflow
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. **Open your browser**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

This creates a `build/` directory with optimized production files.

## 📊 Seed Data

The application comes pre-loaded with:
- **25 Jobs** (mixed active/archived with various tags)
- **1,000 Candidates** randomly assigned to jobs and stages
- **3 Assessments** with 10+ questions each

All data persists in browser's IndexedDB and survives page refreshes.

## 🔧 Technical Decisions

### Why These Technologies?

**React + TypeScript**
- Type safety prevents runtime errors
- Excellent developer experience with IntelliSense
- Large ecosystem and community support

**Zustand**
- Minimal boilerplate compared to Redux
- Built-in persistence
- Simple API for complex state management
- Better performance than Context API

**IndexedDB via Dexie**
- No backend required for demo
- Offline-first architecture
- Handles large datasets efficiently
- Persistent across sessions

**Tailwind CSS**
- Rapid UI development
- Consistent design system
- Custom natural theme
- Easy to maintain and customize

**@dnd-kit**
- Modern, accessible drag-and-drop library
- Better than react-beautiful-dnd
- Supports keyboard navigation
- Optimistic updates out of the box

### Performance Optimizations
- **Virtualization** for large lists (1000+ candidates)
- **Memoization** for expensive calculations
- **Optimistic updates** for instant feedback
- **Lazy loading** for route components
- **Code splitting** for smaller bundles

## 🐛 Known Issues & Solutions

### 1. MSW Integration
**Issue:** MSW was initially included but disabled for simplicity.  
**Solution:** Direct IndexedDB access works perfectly for demo purposes. MSW can be re-enabled if needed for realistic API simulation.

### 2. Candidate Drag-and-Drop in Kanban
**Issue:** Drag-and-drop between stages needs implementation.  
**Solution:** Currently, candidates can be moved between stages via dropdown. Full DnD can be added if needed.

### 3. Conditional Questions Preview
**Issue:** Conditional questions need runtime evaluation.  
**Solution:** Builder supports conditional logic configuration. Full runtime evaluation can be implemented.

### 4. File Upload
**Issue:** File upload is stubbed.  
**Solution:** Basic structure exists. Real file handling can be added.

## 📝 API Endpoints (MSW - For Future)

The following API endpoints are defined but currently use direct IndexedDB access:

- `GET /api/jobs` - List jobs with pagination/filtering
- `POST /api/jobs` - Create new job
- `PATCH /api/jobs/:id` - Update job
- `PATCH /api/jobs/:id/reorder` - Reorder jobs
- `GET /api/candidates` - List candidates with filtering
- `POST /api/candidates` - Create candidate
- `PATCH /api/candidates/:id` - Update candidate
- `GET /api/candidates/:id/timeline` - Get candidate timeline
- `GET /api/assessments/:jobId` - Get assessment
- `PUT /api/assessments/:jobId` - Save assessment
- `POST /api/assessments/:jobId/submit` - Submit assessment response
